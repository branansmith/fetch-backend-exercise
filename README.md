# fetch-backend-exercise

## created by Branan Smith

This is a backend exercise for Fetch, where I used Java Spring boot to allow users to input a receipt in the form of a JSON file. Using specific criteria, points are accumulated based on certain information on the receipt, and after a receipt is submitted, it will return a specific id.

Using this id, you can view the points accumulated for that particular receipt.
